I am a third year PhD student in Economics at the [University of ZÃ¼rich](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/graduatestudents/aina.html). 

My research interest lies at the intersection of behavioral theory and experimental economics.
I am particularly fascinated by the central role of expectations in the underlying motives of human behavior as most decisions are the product of systematic misperceptions of reality, emotions, and strategic reasoning.
